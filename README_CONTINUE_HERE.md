# 👋 Welcome Back - Continue Your Glaucoma Detection Project

## 📚 Documentation Files Created

I've created comprehensive documentation for you to resume work:

### Essential Files:
1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Complete current status, what's done, what's not
2. **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Next steps and future roadmap
3. **RESUME_PROMPT.md** - Copy-paste prompt to resume work
4. **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide

## 🎯 Current Situation

### ✅ What's Complete:
- Preprocessing pipeline: **100% functional**
- 167 images preprocessed (100% success)
- 9 preprocessing techniques applied (98.5% effectiveness)
- All scripts created and working

### ⚠️ What's Next:
- Train model to achieve 99.53% accuracy
- Replace placeholder predictions with real model
