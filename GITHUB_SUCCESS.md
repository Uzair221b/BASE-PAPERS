## 🔄 HOW TO SYNC CHANGES

I've created two simple scripts for you:

### When You Make Changes (Push to GitHub):

**Just run:**
```powershell
.\sync_to_github.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Checks for changes
- Asks for commit message (or uses auto-message)
- Commits your changes
- Pushes to GitHub
- Done!

---

### On Another Computer (Pull from GitHub):

**Just run:**
```powershell
.\pull_from_github.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Gets latest changes from GitHub
- Updates your local files
- Done!

---

## 🔄 Manual Commands (If You Prefer)

### Push changes:
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your message about what changed"
git push origin main
```

### Pull changes:
```powershell
git pull origin main
```

### Check status:
```powershell
git status
