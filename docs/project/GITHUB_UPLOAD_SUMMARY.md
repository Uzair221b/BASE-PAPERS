## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### Before Cleanup:
```
ROOT: 40+ files (messy, confusing)
- 17 duplicate MD files
- 10 training scripts (all failed)
- 8 log files
- 5 temporary PS1 scripts
= TOTAL MESS
```

### After Cleanup:
```
ROOT: Clean & organized
- README.md (clear overview)
- docs/project/ (3 essential docs)
- preprocessing/ (working code)
- processed_datasets/ (ready data)
= EASY TO UNDERSTAND
```
