## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: DO NOT**

- ❌ Close PowerShell/terminal
- ❌ Put laptop to sleep  
- ❌ Restart computer
- ❌ Unplug power cord

## ✅ **IMPORTANT: DO**

- ✅ Keep laptop plugged in
- ✅ Let it run overnight
- ✅ Check progress occasionally
- ✅ Come back in 12-18 hours

---

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS (After Training Completes)**

1. **Check Results:**
   ```powershell
   python check_training_progress.py
   ```

2. **Review Metrics:**
   - Check `results/training_results_*.json`
   - Look at accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
   - Review confusion matrix

3. **If Accuracy ≥ 99%:**
   - ✅ Proceed to cross-validation
   - ✅ Test on other datasets
   - ✅ Generate figures for paper
   - ✅ Update research paper

4. **If Accuracy < 99%:**
   - ⚙️ Fine-tune hyperparameters
   - ⚙️ Train for more epochs
   - ⚙️ Adjust learning rate
