## ⚡ Quick Start (2 Minutes to Begin)

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Open PowerShell in this folder and run:

```powershell
.\install_dependencies.ps1
```

This will install TensorFlow and all required packages (takes 5-10 minutes).

---

### **Step 2: Read Your Complete Action Plan**
Open this file for EVERYTHING you need:

📄 **`docs/guides/YOUR_COMPLETE_ACTION_PLAN.md`**

This document has:
- ✅ Simple ML explanations (train vs test, how models work)
- ✅ Your exact data summary (8,000 EYEPACS images)
- ✅ 10-step roadmap with all commands
- ✅ 2-week timeline
- ✅ How to achieve 99%+ accuracy
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Everything explained simply!

---

### **Step 3: Follow the Plan**

**Week 1:**
1. Install TensorFlow (today - 30 min)
2. Preprocess images (days 2-3 - overnight)
3. Train model (day 4 - 4-6 hours)
4. Test model (day 5 - 30 min)

**Week 2:**
5. Fine-tune to 99%+
6. Validate on other datasets
7. Generate results for research paper
8. Update paper with results
